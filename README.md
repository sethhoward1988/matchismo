Matchismo
=========

Matchismo is a simple iPhone game similar to memory. The goal is to match a certain number of cards together. To get started, simply select a card and then another. If the card is considered a match, then you will receive points. See below for the point breakdown.

##Modes
Matchismo supports two different modes. It supports a two card mode and a three card mode. For the two card mode, you can select up to two cards to find a match. For the three card mode, you may select up to three. The mode can only be chosen at the beginning of each match. Once you start flipping, the option to change the mode is gone.

##Re-deal
You can re deal at any moment by pressing the 'Deal' button. This will reset all of the cards and also the score setting. You may rechoose the game mode at this time.

##Points
Points are awarded everytime that you make a match.
